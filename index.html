	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I'm new to computer science world, almost to every aspect of it. It happened so, that I came from unexpected sphere of life to computer science. 
		Playing video games never excited me that much, as the process of game developing, or just realising how all components work together. I'm also facinated by robotics: the way the mechanism works, the way all the details move together, the way the scensors are used and information is colleted, analysed and used... All these is just so unbelivable!
		On one hand coding is really interesting, but on the other hand I also do like graphical stuff: not a lot of people will be willing to play a game only with good mechanics. Especially since I'm a girl, I pay a lot of attention to bright colors and nice pictures, appearance.
		Currently I'm trying to learn and use programming languages to create own projects, games and automatize evrything that should and can be automatized.
		Apart from technical stuff I like sport, I have played tennis for mor than 12 years(currently don't have enough time for this sport), I also played volleyball at my nowosibirsk's university team.
		I like taking photos and working with graphical editors. Sometimes to calm me down, I craft: bead-fancywork, toys sewing etc.. </p>
